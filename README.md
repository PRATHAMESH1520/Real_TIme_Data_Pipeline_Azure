# Real_Time_Data_Pipeline_Azure
In this project i had created a real time data pipeline which can be scheduled on daily basis which will collect the data present from raw container to specific employee and department container by converting file in csv format.Initially data is in json format in azure blob storage account.Also created a pipeline which will be able to join the employee and department file based on department id and will further store into another new container naming emp_dept container.
